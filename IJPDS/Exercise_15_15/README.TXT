Exercise 15.15 from "Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures", 11th Edition by Y. Daniel Lang.

INSTRUCTIONS:
(Geometry: add and remove points) Write a program that lets the user click on
a pane to dynamically create and remove points (see Figure 15.30a). When the
user left-clicks the mouse (primary button), a point is created and displayed
at the mouse point. The user can remove a point by pointing to it and rightclicking
the mouse (secondary button).
